# Crowd2Map_Viz
Visualize the mapping efforts of HOT support of FGM elimination
   
Volunteers from all over the world are contributing to ending Female Genitalia Mutilation (FGM) by mapping roads and buildings in the areas where girls are most at risk. Mapping data helps activists better reach girls, and plan their outreach work. Remote mappers also create base maps that communities on the ground add to using mobile apps and printed fieldpapers to build up village level maps needed for development and documenting land rights.
